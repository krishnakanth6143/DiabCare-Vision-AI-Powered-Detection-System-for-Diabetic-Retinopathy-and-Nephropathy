# DiabCare Vision: AI-Powered Detection System for Diabetic Retinopathy and Nephropathy

## Project Overview
DiabCare Vision is an advanced AI-based diagnostic system that combines computer vision and machine learning to detect diabetic retinopathy and predict nephropathy risk. The system uses a hybrid approach, leveraging Swin Transformer for retinal image classification and ensemble methods (Random Forest + XGBoost) for nephropathy prediction.

## Key Features
- **Retinal Disease Detection**: Accurately classify AMD, Glaucoma, Cataract, and Diabetic Retinopathy using advanced image analysis
- **Nephropathy Prediction**: Assess kidney complication risks based on clinical parameters
- **Explainable Results**: Transparent predictions with interpretable AI explanations (SHAP and LIME)
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly application for uploading images and inputting medical parameters

## Technologies Used
- **Swin Transformer**: Hierarchical feature extraction through shifted window self-attention
- **Ensemble ML Models**: Combining Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: SHAP and LIME for model interpretability
- **Flask**: Web application framework
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend user interface

## How It Works
1. Users upload retinal images and input medical parameters
2. The system processes the images using Swin Transformer models
3. Clinical data is analyzed using ensemble machine learning models
4. Results are displayed with explanations of key factors influencing predictions

## Benefits
- Improved diagnostic accuracy
- Early detection of complications
- Transparent AI decisions
- Accessible advanced diagnostics

## Installation and Setup
Instructions for setting up and running the project locally will be added soon.
