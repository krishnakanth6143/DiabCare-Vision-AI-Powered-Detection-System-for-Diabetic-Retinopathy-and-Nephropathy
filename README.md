## Overview

DiabCare is an advanced AI-powered web application designed to detect and classify diabetic complications, specifically diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning algorithms. The system combines computer vision models for retinal image analysis with ensemble machine learning approaches for predicting kidney complications based on medical parameters.

## Features

- **Retinal Disease Detection**: Accurately classifies different stages of diabetic retinopathy (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferate DR) and other retinal conditions using advanced image analysis
- **Nephropathy Prediction**: Assesses kidney complication risks based on clinical parameters like age, diabetes duration, blood pressure, etc.
- **Explainable Results**: Provides transparent and interpretable AI explanations for diagnoses
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive web application for uploading retinal images and inputting medical parameters
- **AI-Assisted Chatbot**: Built-in assistant to help users understand their results and provide guidance

## Technologies Used

### Computer Vision Models
- **Swin Transformer**: Hierarchical feature extraction through shifted window self-attention for retinal image classification
